This repository is a space for all of my exercises, practices, learning experiences, etc. I will be using this repo mainly for building my experiences over time.

Bear with me, I'm still inexperienced on coding and doing my best to be better at programming. Please, do give me some insights on what I should improve, focus, getting better at.

Thank you!
