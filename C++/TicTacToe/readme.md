# ⭕❌⭕ TicTacToe

This is a simple project of making a working TicTacToe program!

To play TicTacToe, simply run the file in terminal and type in ./tictac (Linux).
The program works as in following -> the numbers will indicate which spot to be marked, 
you as the player will choose between the number from 1 - 9!

To pick a certain square, it goes from left to right, and repeat for the next row!
Below here is how each spot is positioned!

1|2|3\
4|5|6\
7|8|9

Thank you for trying out this simple TicTacToe program! :D
